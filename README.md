## Pet Care
This project was created by me, Nathalie Larsson, as my degree project during my education to become a frontend developer.

The Web App is a user-friendly and responsive web application that simplifies the lives of pet owners by consolidating several essential functions in one place. The app allows users to create user profiles, pet profiles, add a new pet, remode a new pet and book services such as veterinary visits and grooming for their animals. The goal is to provide a comprehensive platform that combines health care, service booking, and relevant tips tailored for both new and experienced pet owners. The app is developed with a focus on mobile responsiveness and easy navigation.
(Note that i did not have cross-browser in mind while developing so if it looks a bit wonky, please try another browser like (yes I know) chrome)

### Getting Started
Follow these steps to clone and start the project locally on your machine:

- Clone the repo

- cd into the right folder

The project uses pnpm, a fast and efficient package manager that saves space by linking dependencies instead of duplicating them.
If you don't have pnpm installed:

(If you do have pnpm, skip this step)

```
npm install -g pnpm@latest-10
```
or 
```
npm install -g pnpm
```
Then install dependencies:

```
pnpm install
```

Start the development server

```
pnpm run dev
```

- Open in your browser
  Go to: http://localhost:3000 (or another port if you're using something other than Vite).

And voila, there you go, it should work as smooth as ice cream melts on a sunny day üç¶
