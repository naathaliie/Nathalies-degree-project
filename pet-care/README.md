Pet Care
Is a project made by me, Nathalie Larsson as my degree project for my education as a frotend developer.

The Web App is a user-friendly and responsive web application that simplifies the lives of pet owners by consolidating several essential functions in one place. The app allows users to create pet profiles, receive health care reminders, and book services such as veterinary visits and grooming for their animals. The goal is to provide a comprehensive platform that combines health tracking, service booking, and relevant tips tailored for both new and experienced pet owners. The app is developed with a focus on mobile responsiveness and easy navigation.
(note that i did not have cross-browser in mind while developing so if it looks a bit wonky, please try another browser like (yes I know) chrome)

Getting Started
Follow these steps to clone and start the project locally:

Clone the repo

cd your-repo

Install dependencies

The project uses pnpm, a fast and efficient package manager that saves space by linking dependencies instead of duplicating them.
If you don't have pnpm installed:

bash
npm install -g pnpm

Then install dependencies:

bash
pnpm install

Start the development server

bash
pnpm run dev

Open in your browser
Go to: http://localhost:3000 (or another port if you're using something other than Vite).

And voila, there you go, it should work as smooth as ice cream on a sunny day.
